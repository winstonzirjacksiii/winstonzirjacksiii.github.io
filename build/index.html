        <p>I'm a front-end web developer with a penchant for developing clean and usable interfaces. Working with scalable and mantainable stylesheets, building semantic and cross-browser compatable HTML and CSS, and pappering content with UX that helps tells stories instead of holding hands.</p>
        <p>My previous experiance is veried. The first allegorical sugar packet steadying the legs of my current skillset is from a start-up where we designed and built a web-based point-of-sale system. The second packet was spent at an agency where we built web-apps for tech-industry events. The final and third packet is currently being filled at an agency where aid local businesses by designing and implementing sites for popular e-commerce systems and custom CMSs.</p>
        <p>We all know how difficult it is to write about yourself. So instead of going free-form, we're gonna' keep it a bit structured:</p>
