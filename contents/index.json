    "My previous experiance is veried. The first allegorical sugar packet steadying the legs of my current skillset is from a start-up where we designed and built a web-based point-of-sale system. The second packet was spent at an agency where we built web-apps for tech-industry events. The final and third packet is currently being filled at an agency where aid local businesses by designing and implementing sites for popular e-commerce systems and custom CMSs.",
