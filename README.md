# wz-portfolio_simple
A simple portfolio mostly for the sake of organizing personal information together in one place.

Built with Wintersmith for the sake of sharing content between both a simple and complex template. Run 'npm install' to install wintersmith and then 'npm run preview' to run the wintersmith preview server. You can also run 'npm run build' if you'd like to generate a /build folder that will contain the outputted site files.
