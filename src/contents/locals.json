  "what-im-about": [
    "I'm a front-end web developer with a penchant for developing clean and usable interfaces. I enjoy and take pride in working with scalable and maintainable stylesheets, building semantic and cross-browser compatible HTML, and peppering content with UX that helps tells stories instead of holding hands.",
    "I learned to code at a start-up where we designed and built a web-based point-of-sale system using HAML, SASS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. From there I transferred to an agency and built web-apps for tech-industry events. Leaving that to freelance, learning to appreciate teamwork and stability soon led me to reconsider professional arrangements. And finally, that stability was found at an agency in which we aid local businesses by designing and implementing sites for popular e-commerce systems.",
    "Sure it sounds clich√©, but I thrive in situations where you need to think on your feet. Learning is exciting to me and the key to all of my personal and professional interests. Working on, maintaining, and updating my skill set is something that I constantly strive towards.",
    "Let's be honest here: I just want to use my skills to help people do stuff better. Let me use my skills to help empower your vision, project, or technical whimsey."

  "simple-note": [
    "I designed and built this website with simplicity in mind. It's readable, clean, and anyone can navigate its content intuitively. Most browsers will be able to load this page predictably and consistently. It's already responsive and the page-weight is incredibly low.",
    "This design took inspiration from <a href='http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/' target='_blank'>http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/</a> website, while adding in some low-cost reset and animation CSS. It's still lightweight, but you can always check back (eventually) for a link at the top of the page to see a more slightly more fancy portfolio design."
  ],
  "fancy-note": [
    "This is more of an iteration over the original simple portfolio with some added responsive grid systeming, colors, images, and even more animations.",
    "The goal is to show off my work with some subtle CSS and JS. Please note: I am not a designer. Giving feedback on designs is something that comes very easily to me, but starting from scratch is still difficult without collaboration."

I took a database dump from a Magento installation and with Python and a handfull of libraries converted it into a CSV spreadsheet while transposing and importing information to reflect the changes in environment. On top of that, the theme featured the usual Sleepless Media design and flair, along with a custom-built filter system for the collection view built exclusively with the Liquid templating language."

The themes themselves are both modular and easily editable/maintainable by the client. While not technically impressive, this project represents my ability to work on a team and iterate over ideas, design fallbacks, and to ultimately build to a design approved by a large group of people."

      "desc": "This is one of the first Shopify projects in our agency where I was able to develop using the Shopify theme kit toolkit. Themekit allows for local development, so we were finally able to use NPM build tools and git for organizing code and versioning. We also needed to overcome limits imposed on the Shopify system (multiple sections of information attached to products instead of just the single \"description\" text) while allowing the client to easily maintain the content with full WYSIWYG editing ability. Due to budget constraints, we opted to avoid app development and instead repurposed menu and page objects through a naming system to allow section modularity within a system where those features weren't explicitly supported."
